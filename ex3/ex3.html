        <div class="bio">
            <p>
                A behind-the-stars songwriter, music producer, and actor as well as a singer/songwriter in his own right,
                Los Angeles native Finneas (Finneas O'Connell)is recognized for his sleek and intimate alternative pop style.
                He emerged on the international stage first as an actor -- he appeared in the film Bad Teacher (2011)
                and on TV's Glee (2015), among other roles as a teenager -- before drawing accolades in the late 2010s for
                his Grammy-nominated contributions to the outcast anthems of his sister, Billie Eilish. Following the March 2019
                release of her breakthrough full-length, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?, and related touring as
                a member of her live band, he stepped forward with his own debut album, Blood Harmony, in October 2019.
